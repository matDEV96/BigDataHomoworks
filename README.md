# BigDataHomoworks
Homeworks for the course on Big Data Computing, held @University of Padua

DONE:   Selection of starting centers via KMeans++ (weighted)
		Initial testing (no errors raised)
		Started work on rnd set of points to test algorithm (e.g. benchmark it against libraries)
STILL TO DO:    Cost function and centers refinement via Lloyd's algorithm
				Performance testing (probably optional)
				Algorithm accuracy testing (needed)
