# BigDataHomoworks
## Homeworks for the course on Big Data Computing, held @University of Padua   
   
### DONE:   
	* Selection of starting centers via KMeans++ (weighted)  
	* KMeansObj function
	* Initial testing (no errors raised)  
	* Started work on rnd set of points to test algorithm (e.g. benchmark it against libraries)  
### STILL MISSING:    
	* Centers refinement via Lloyd's algorithm  
	* Performance testing (probably optional)  
	* Algorithm accuracy testing (needed)
